For milestone 1, we have made a Makefile and skeleton main.cpp.

For milestone 2, for the majority of the time we worked on the assignment, we met together through Zoom, usually taking turns sharing screen and coding. We worked together except for implementing certain helper functions (Thomas worked on getting the index bits and file I/O, while Ted implemented the basic cache, for example), and we went off of the previous progress.

For milestone 3, we worked together to implement the FIFO portion of the assignment and fix how we calculated total cycles. Ted refactored the code and figured out a bit shifting solution for handling addresses. Thomas also wrote a bash program to perform a grid search over parameters that we discussed in our README pdf.

Our README pdf is called: csfhw3writeup.pdf
